The webextension removes series description sections from the series listed in Anichart for easily made collage. Works with the site's color highlighting function, including hiding red ones (has to be done via site options, as usual). Currently confirmed to work in FireFox 53.0.3.

The view is toggled from buttons at right top. You may need to refresh the page for the extension to work.
